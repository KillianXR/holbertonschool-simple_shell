.Sh DESCRIPTION              
This project is a simple UNIX command-line interpreter, or shell, developed as part of the Holberton School curriculum. 
The shell replicates basic functionalities of /bin/sh and provides an environment where users can execute commands interactively 
or in non-interactive mode.

The shell only supports basic commands by path and a custom implementation of the `ls` command for listing files in a directory.

.Sh HISTORY
The `HSH` shell was developed as part of the Holberton School project to provide us with a basic understanding of UNIX shells and an inner workings.
